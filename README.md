# Tribes That May Be

You find yourself in an endless desert with some books and barely appropriate provisions.

Have fun with that.

# Launching the modpack

It is recommended that people use [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) to run this modpack. To download the most recent version of the modpack, visit [this](https://github.com/tribesthatmaybe/modpack/actions?query=workflow%3Amake-modpack) site, and click on whichever build is at the top of the list. From there, you can download a client and server artifact. The URL of the client artifact can be used when adding an instance in MultiMC when importing as a zip file.

The artifact installed on the ttmb-dev server is [this](https://github.com/tribesthatmaybe/modpack/actions/runs/134542918) one. If you want to try connecting, the server host is `ttmbdev.spmc.co`. If you find bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/tribesthatmaybe/modpack/issues).
